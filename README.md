# Our Innovation!
 - AI + Mobile application along with in store machine that scans your waste material that you bring back with you in your next trip to store to recycle, which will not only make you a responsible citizen but also reward you for doing your bit towards society. 
 - The rewarding system will not be one way system which will give out rewards for waste management, but through analysis it will provide customised rewards and prizes to each citizen based on their waste management practice and responsibility. 
 - Each customer profile will be segmented based on their purchase and waste returns to calculate their reward points and benefits.
 - The application will also provide an interface to customer to take equal part in companies CSR activities and donations with feeds updates for their donations. An engaging and interactive application that will help both customer and company to complete the circular waste management and economy model.
